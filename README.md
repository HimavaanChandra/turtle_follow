## Turtlebot Following Task
This project controls a Turtlebot robot with the task of following another Turtlebot.This will be done through the development of a program with the application of sensing, path planning and control.A  Gazebo  simulation  will  also  be  used  allowing  for  a  plethora  of  testing  to  be  conducted  in  a  safe  and controlled environment. This will be donebefore introducing real world testing that couldpose a risk to studentand staffsafety as well as damageto the Turtlebot and surrounding environment. Sensors that will be utilized for this project include an RGB-D sensor for the detection of the other robot and a LiDAR for close range peripheral sensing.


This program and simulation will then be able to be utilized as a template for future following, sensing and movement projects. This involves projects in the automatedmanufacturing, autonomous mining and farming, public transport,and private civilian transportindustries.The application of real-world sensors will  also provide  experience and  knowledge  that will  prove  to bebeneficial  for future projects.
